# dynUGENE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

dynUGENE is an R package for the inference, simulation, and visualization of gene regulatory network dynamics from time-series expression data.

## Description

dynUGENE build off dynGENIE3, an algorithm to infer gene network architecture and dynamics given time-series or steady-state expression data.

dynUGENE provides several additional functionalities on top of dynGENIE3.

  * Visualization of the inferred network as a heatmap.
  * Simulation of the learned system given any initial condition.
  * Stochastic simulations by accounting for uncertainty in the random forests' predictions
  * Model selection using a Pareto front by comparing model error with model complexity.
  * Additional datasets (repressilator, Hodgkin-Huxley) both deterministic and stochastic.


## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of dynUGENE from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("dynUGENE") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Install the development version with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tianyu-lu/dynUGENE", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("dynUGENE")
```

## Overview

```{r Overview}
library("dynUGENE")
ls(package:dynUGENE)
data(package="dynUGENE")
```

We can learn the architecture and simulate the dynamics of a repressilator with `inferNetwork()`:

We can perform a search over possible sparse network architectures with `tuneThreshold()`.

We can also learn the dynamics of a stochastic repressilator:

We can also visualize the learned networks for large, steady-state datasets:

## Contributions

With the exception of `estimateDecayRates.R`, the remaining files are original code. `inferNetwork.R` is a re-implementation of the dynGENIE3 algorithm in R. The original implementation wraps around a random forest implementation written in C. dynuGENE implements everything in R. Sources for snippets of code when taken from examples are provided near the code in question.

## Example

Load and do inference with repressilator data:

```{r example}
library(dynUGENE)

## Infer network
ugene <- inferNetwork(Repressilator, mtry=3L)

## Deterministic simulation of the inferred network dynamics
x0 <- Repressilator[1, 2:7]
trajectory <- simulateUGENE(ugene, x0)
plotTrajectory(trajectory, c("p3", "p2", "p1"))

## Stochastic simulation
trajectory <- simulateUGENE(ugene, x0, stochastic=TRUE)
plotTrajectory(trajectory, c("p3", "p2", "p1"))
```
