# dynUGENE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

dynUGENE is an R package for the inference, simulation, and visualization of gene regulatory network dynamics from time-series expression data.

## Description

dynUGENE build off dynGENIE3, an algorithm to infer gene network architecture and dynamics given time-series or steady-state expression data.

dynUGENE provides several additional functionalities on top of dynGENIE3.

  * Visualization of the inferred network as a heatmap.
  * Simulation of the learned system given any initial condition.
  * Stochastic simulations by accounting for uncertainty in the random forests' predictions
  * Model selection using a Pareto front by comparing model error with model complexity.
  * Additional datasets (repressilator, Hodgkin-Huxley) both deterministic and stochastic.

The package is useful for those who wish to build explainable models of gene regulatory networks with varying degrees of complexity. The package is also useful for synthetic biologists who wish to design genetic circuits that match some desired dynamical or steady-state properties. 

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of dynUGENE from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("dynUGENE") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Install the development version with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tianyu-lu/dynUGENE", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("dynUGENE")
```

The package is also available as a Shiny app on at [tianyulu.shinyapps.io/dynUGENE/](https://tianyulu.shinyapps.io/dynUGENE/) or can be run locally with

```r
dynUGENE::rundynUGENE()
```

The Shiny app includes a tutorial and interactivity with the outputs of dynUGENE. In particular, useful features of the app include the following:

 * Visualize each of the stepwise-tuned networks
 * Select custom masks by clicking on the heatmap cells to be masked
 * Interactive simulation plot allows zooming

## Contributions

Package author: Tianyu Lu. 

With the exception of `estimateDecayRates.R`, the remaining files are original code. `inferNetwork.R` is a re-implementation of the dynGENIE3 algorithm in R. The original implementation wraps around a random forest implementation written in C. dynuGENE implements everything in R. The `randomForest` package is used to train random forests. `ramify` is used to obtain column-wise argmax of matrices. Plots for `inferNetwork()` are made with `ggplot2` and preprocessing done by `reshape2`. Plots for `inferSSNetwork()` are made with `gplots` and colours specified by `RColorBrewer`. The `stats` package is used to estimate mean and variance from the random forests predictions and to sample from a Gaussian.

Sources for code adapted from examples are provided near the code in question.

## Functionality

We can learn the architecture and simulate the dynamics of a repressilator with `inferNetwork()`:

![](inst/extdata/rep-network.png){width=50%}
![](inst/extdata/rep-simulation.png){width=50%}

We can perform a search over possible sparse network architectures with `tuneThreshold()`.

![Step 7 from step-wise search of architectures](inst/extdata/rep-network-from-mask7.png){width=45%}

We can also learn the dynamics of a stochastic repressilator:

![](inst/extdata/rep-stochastic-trajectory.png){width=70%}

We can also visualize the learned networks for large, steady-state datasets:

![A section of the 300x300 gene regulatory network in SynTReN300](inst/extdata/syntren-zoom.png){width=70%}

Load and do inference with repressilator data:

```{r example}
library(dynUGENE)

## Infer network
ugene <- inferNetwork(Repressilator, mtry = 3L)

## Deterministic simulation of the inferred network dynamics
x0 <- Repressilator[1, 2:7]
trajectory <- simulateUGENE(ugene, x0)
plotTrajectory(trajectory, c("p3", "p2", "p1"))

## Stochastic simulation
trajectory <- simulateUGENE(ugene, x0, stochastic = TRUE)
plotTrajectory(trajectory, c("p3", "p2", "p1"))
```

## Runtime

`inferNetwork()` take about 30 seconds for automatic threshold tuning for the Repressilator dataset.

`simulateUGENE()` takes about 3 minutes for simulating 5000 timesteps of a 6 component system.

Tests: running the unit and integration tests takes about three minutes on a typical laptop.
